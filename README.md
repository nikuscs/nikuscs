👋 I'm Pedro Martins, a Full-Stack Developer & Product Engineer. I've dedicated nearly two decades of my life to web development & programming.

Passionate about building products from scratch, I enjoy every step of the process, from market research and design to SEO, development, and crafting polished, pixel-perfect UIs.

I love to read and learn about everything tech-related, keeping myself updated and in the loop in this fast-moving industry. Check out my Blog where I share my knowledge, learnings, snippets & interesting articles with the community.
Away from the screens, I enjoy travelling 🏖️, retro gaming, tinkering with hardware, automation, networking, music, casual drinking, ethical hacking and never forgetting to touch grass 🌱

In 2026 i believe languages are NOT important anymore, software arch is.

I also do some open-source at: [Flavorly ®](https://github.com/orgs/flavorly/repositories?type=source) , [INDIGIT ®](https://github.com/indigitpt)
